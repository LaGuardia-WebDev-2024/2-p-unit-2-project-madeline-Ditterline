<h3>Beinecke rare book and manuscript library</h3>!
if there is a fire they will suffocate you.
one of the largest buldings dedicated to rare books in the world
stephen a schwarzman
you need explicit permission to even use the books in the main reading room
or you could do a tour but that's just not the same man\
ive been here! icouldnt get into the reading room bc i didn't book a tourbut the work rooms are cool too
like a museum
tons of rare stuff
